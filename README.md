# NumberKeyboardLayout

------
A number keyboard has near full function of System Keyboard. <br />
I only focus to create a number decimal keyboard, But I have implemented some event to get usefully for my keyboard. <br />
I hope you will get more benefit from it, so you can custom a owner keyboard with text only, number un-sign only, phone only, password only ... etc. <br />

height of keyboard will equal 1/3 screen height. you can set height with new number if you want
```
 <com.taindb.library.NumberKeyboardLayout
            android:id="@+id/numberKeyBoard"
            android:layout_gravity="bottom"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```
